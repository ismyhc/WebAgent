# WebAgent is a super lightweight modern networking library utilizing the Combine framework

First off I'd like to give credit to Vadim Bulavin from [Yet Another Swift Blog](https://www.vadimbulavin.com). This library is highly inspired by his blog post [Modern Networking in Swift 5 with URLSession, Combine and Codable](https://www.vadimbulavin.com/modern-networking-in-swift-5-with-urlsession-combine-framework-and-codable/)

ðŸš§ Warning. This library is under heavy construction. Use at your own risk.
